# Set-up

Black places a castle and chooses a direction first
White then places his castle and choose a direction

Placing a castle:
    Castles take up 4x4 squares and cannot be placed over
    water or over other castles. The resources beneath cannot
    be collected.

Choosing a direction:
    The King can placed facing North, South, East, or West
    If facing North or South he will be on the Eastside of the castle
    If facing East or West he will be on the Southside of the castle
    The placement of the rest of the pieces is dependant on the King and
    what version of set-up is being played.
    Pawns will be placed in front of the King, and the highest ranking
    piece will be placed beside the King (West or North)

White moves first
Then Black
Repeat
